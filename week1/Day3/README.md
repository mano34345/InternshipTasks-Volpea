## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a **practice webpage** created for Internship Task 3, focused on applying and experimenting with a wide range of front-end concepts including HTML semantics, CSS animations, responsive design, interactive elements, and theme toggling.

The purpose of this page is to consolidate various small but powerful web development concepts into a single, well-organized and responsive layout.
