# Iman's Internship First Task

## Overview
This is the first task of my internship, where I created a simple personal profile webpage using HTML. The webpage showcases my introduction, hobbies, daily routine, a placeholder for my profile picture, and a link to my GitHub profile.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of my personal profile webpage.

## Features
- **Introduction**: A brief introduction about myself, including my name and interest in web development.
- **Hobbies**: An unordered list of my hobbies, such as reading, designing, and coding.
- **Daily Routine**: An ordered list outlining my typical daily activities.
- **Profile Picture**: A placeholder image tag for my profile picture.
- **GitHub Link**: A clickable link to my GitHub profile for visitors to explore my projects.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mano34345/internship-volpea.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the profile webpage.

## Notes
- The image file (`IMG-20241020-WA0040.jpg`) referenced in the HTML is a placeholder. Ensure the actual image file is placed in the same directory as `index.html` or update the `src` attribute with the correct path.
- The GitHub link points to my repository for this internship task.

## Future Improvements
- Add CSS to style the webpage for better visual appeal.
- Include a functional profile picture.
- Expand the content with more details about my skills and projects.
